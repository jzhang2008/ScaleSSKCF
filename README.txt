This MATLAB code implements the proposed method (ScaleSSKCF)in the paper: Part-based Visual Tracking via Structural Support Correlation Filter, which has been published by JVCIR recently.

Installation: To be able to run the "mexResize" function, try to use either one of the included mex-files or compile one of your own. OpenCV is needed for this. The existing compile scripts "compilemex.m" or "compilemex_win.m" can be modified for this purpose.

Instructions:

Run the "run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB. or you can download the OTB50 datasets and OTB2013 toolkit. In our codes, we provide the interface function: run_ScaleSSKCF.m
